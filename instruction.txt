The new Government Order (GO) that scaled down the grace mark allotted to sportspersons for their meritorious achievements has drawn sharp criticism from all stakeholders.

The GO passed by General Education Department on April 20 greatly reduced the grace marks awarded to sportspersons for SSLC and Plus Two courses. As per new GO, a participation in an international event will fetch the sportsperson 30 marks while for the national events, the grace mark was fixed at 25. The grace mark for individual winners in State events has been fixed at 20 while it is 17 marks for the runner-up and 14 marks for third place. The new GO also doesnâ€™t grant any grace mark to athletes and swimmers finishing between fourth and eighth positions in State-level events.

The existing grace marks allotted to sportspersons till the new GO was 150 marks for participation in international events and it was 60 for national events. The corresponding grace mark for winners in State events was 30, 24 for runner-up, and 18 for third.
